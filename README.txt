Compilation:


The makefile provides with 3 compiling programs.
 
The AVL tree testing program can be compiled using:



make avl



This will add 15 numbers to a tree in the given order and then will print the
numbers in order from minimum to maximum.
The AVL tree test tests createTree, addToTree, removeFromTree and find functions.



The main (File manager) program can be compiled using:



make main



This will create the program named main in the bin directory. 
The program can be ran with a set directory provided as the argv after ./bin/main 
or it will use the current directory. 


**********************************************************************************



Running:


The AVL tree test program runs automatically showing along the way what it is 
doing.

The File Manager is easy to use. The user has 4 options to choose from:

1. Delete a file

2. Rename a file

3. Move a file

4. Exit


The user selects an option by typing in the corresponding number and entering. 
When giving the file name, the program requires the entire path to the file
 including the filename.
